# Embedded Plant Sensor
STM32 embedded system project developed in C for the NUCLEO-F401RE microcontroller board. This environmental monitoring system uses a temperature/humidity sensor and a photoresistor to track ambient conditions. Sensor data is processed and displayed in real time on an LCD screen via GPIO, with all components connected through a breadboard.
